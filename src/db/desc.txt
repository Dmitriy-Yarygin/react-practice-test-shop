I-SEA' is a high performance cruiser that flaunts hull #09 of the successful
SW 100 mini-series designed by Farr Yacht Design (Naval Architecture)
and Nauta Design (General concept, interior and exterior design).

Having had only one owner and a single Captain, I-Sea has been impeccably maintained and has recently benefited from significant technical investments, including the upgrading of the rigging from Rod to Carbon EC6+, a topside repaint and a new set of cruising sail.
